# Remove-Duplicates
A JavaFx application that deletes duplicate/redundant files from your system's file manager.

To run the program from the command line, ensure you are in the working directory where RemoveDuplicates.java is stored. Then, in the command line enter:

javac --module-path "Path to your javafx lib folder" --add-modules javafx.controls RemoveDuplicates.java

Finally, run:

java --module-path "Path to your javafx lib folder" --add-modules javafx.controls RemoveDuplicates

WARNING: Running this program does not move files to your system's trash/recyling bin. These files will be permanantly deleted from your hard drive.
